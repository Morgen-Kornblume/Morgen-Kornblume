## About my name

### Origin & Meaning

In my memory, I have been using this name for about 7 years (from 2023). I was a newbie in OI at that time, and I was preparing for the NOIP. I was thinking about a name for myself, that time, maybe I want the name 'Morgan', but I worngly spelled it as 'Morgen'. Latter, I found that 'Morgen' is a German word, which means 'morning'. I like this word, so I decided to use it as my name.

As for 'Kornblume', it is a German word too, which means 'blue cornflower'. I like this flower, and was moved by its flower meaning —— 'Happiness, brightness, meeting, gentleness' , I love German culture, kornblume is Germany's national flower, and think it is the ideal character of a DDR in dream. So I decided to use it as my family name.


## Some plans

Not decided yet, but I'm planning to write a light novel. I have some ideas, but I'm not sure whether I can finish it.

Sorry I can't come up with a good translation for these names.
